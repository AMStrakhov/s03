"""
Description:

Write a script that tries to convert the input value into
an integer. If it is not possible, the script should print a message
from the caught exception, like:

Error: <msg from exception>

For example:
Error: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '{value}'

If the input value was converted successfully, it should print:
OK

If any case it should print:
Finished

You should solve this problem, using all `try/except...` elements.


Example:
Input: abc
Output:
Error: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'abc'
Finished

Input: 1
Output:
OK
Finished
