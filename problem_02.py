"""
Description:

Write a script with two integer inputs. The first value is a limit (positive or negative),
and the second is a divider. The script should print all integers
from 0 to the limit that are divisible by the divider without a remainder.

If the divider is 0, catch an exception and print once:
"Error: Division by zero"

Example:
Input: 10
3
Output: 0
3
6
9

Input: -10
3
Output: 0
-3
-6
-9
